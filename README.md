# sf_crime_study 
Analysis of a 15-year reported incident dataset from SFPD using Spark and Sklearn [(Here)](https://github.com/VivianMaiqy/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/sf_crime_study.ipynb)
  - Graphically showed the properties of the incident dataset: case count by crime category, by hour of day, by day of week, by district, and the reasonable clusters of crime locations in SF (use K-means).
  - Used machine learning methods to understand crime patterns and distribution in SF.
  - Built a time-series forecast model to forecast the number of crimes per day in SF.
