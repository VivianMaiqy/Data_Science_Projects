# [Study of Crime in San Francisco](https://github.com/VivianMaiqy/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/sf_crime_study.ipynb)
Analysis of a 15-year reported incident dataset from SFPD using Spark and Sklearn
  - Graphically showed the properties of the incident dataset: case count by crime category, by hour of day, by day of week, by district, and the reasonable clusters of crime locations in SF (use K-means).
  - Used machine learning methods to understand crime patterns and distribution in SF.
  - Built a time-series forecast model to forecast the number of crimes per day in SF. 
  - Dataset comes from : https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/

# [Customer Churn Rate Study](https://github.com/VivianMaiqy/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/customer_churn_study.ipynb)
This project is about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning". Churn rate is one the most important business metrics, which is useful when a company compares its churn rate with its growth rate. When the churn rate is higher than the growth rate, the company has experienced a loss in its customer base.
  - Graphically displayed all numerical features in the data
  - Used three different machine learning models to understand the training data
    - LogisticRegression 
    - RandomForestClassifier 
    - GradientBoostingClassifier 
  - Used the best machine learning model and the testing data to predict whether a churning will happen on a customer. 
  - Dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/customer-churn-prediction-2020/data?select=sampleSubmission.csv
